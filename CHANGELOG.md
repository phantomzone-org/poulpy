# CHANGELOG

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-27

### `poulpy-schemes`
 - Added `sign` argument to GGSW-based blind rotation, which enables to choose the rotation direction of the test vector.

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-27

### `poulpy-hal`
- Improved convolution functionality

### `poulpy-core`
 - Rename `GLWEToLWESwitchingKey` to `GLWEToLWEKey`.
 - Rename `LWEToGLWESwitchingKey` to `LWEToGLWEKey`.
 - Add `GLWESecretTensor` which stores the flattened upper right of the tensor matrix of the pairs  `sk[i] * sk[j]`.
 - Add `GGLWEToGGSWKey`, `GGLWEToGGSWKeyPrepared`, `GGLWEToGGSWKeyCompressed`, which encrypts the full tensor matrix of all pairs `sk[i] * sk[j]`, with one `GGLWE` per row.
 - Update `GGLWEToGGSW` API to take `GGLWEToGGSWKey` instead of the `GLWETensorKey`
 - Add `GLWETensor`, the result of tensoring two `GLWE` of identical rank.
 - Changed `GLWETensorKey` to be an encryption of `GLWESecretTensor` (preliminary work for `GLWEFromGLWETensor`, a.k.a relinearization). 

### `poulpy-schemes`
 - Add `GLWEBlindRotation`, a `GGSW`-based blind rotation that evaluates `GLWE <- GLWE * X^{((k>>bit_rsh) % 2^bit_mask) << bit_lsh}.` (`k` = `FheUintBlocksPrepared`).
 - Add `GGSWBlindRotation`, a `GGSW`-based blind rotation that evaluates `GGSW <- (GGSW or ScalarZnx) * X^{((k>>bit_rsh) % 2^bit_mask) << bit_lsh}.` (`k` = `FheUintBlocksPrepared`).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-24

### `poulpy-hal`
 - Add bivariate convolution (X, Y) / (X^{N} + 1) with Y = 2^-K

### `poulpy-core`
 - Fix typo in impl of GGLWEToRef for GLWEAutomorphismKey that required the data to be mutable.

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-23

- Fixed builds on MACOS

### Breaking changes
 - The changes to `poulpy-core` required to break some of the existing API. For example the API `prepare_alloc` has been removed and the trait `Prepare<...>` has been broken down for each different ciphertext type (e.g. GLWEPrepare). To achieve the same functionality, the user must allocated the prepared ciphertext, and then call prepare on it.

### `poulpy-hal`
 - Added cross-base2k normalization

### `poulpy-core`
 - Added functionality-based traits, which removes the need to import the low-levels traits of `poulpy-hal` and makes backend agnostic code much cleaner. For example instead of having to import each individual traits required for the encryption of a GLWE, only the trait `GLWEEncryptSk` is needed.

### `poulpy-schemes`
 - Added basic framework for binary decicion circuit (BDD) arithmetic along with some operations.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-15

### Breaking changes
 - Updated the trait `FillUniform` to take `log_bound`.

### `poulpy-hal`
 - Added pure Rust reference code for `vec_znx` and `fft64` backend.
 - Added cross-backend generic test suite along with macros.
 - Added benchmark generic test suite.

### `poulpy-backend`
 - Added `FFTRef` backend, which provides an implementation relying on the reference code of `poulpy-hal`.
 - Added `FFTAvx` backend, which provides a pure Rust AVX/FMA accelerated implementation of `FFTRef` backend.
 - Added cross-backend tests between `FFTRef` and `FFTAvx`.
 - Added cross-backend tests between `FFTRef` and `FFT64Spqlios`.

### `poulpy-core`
 - Removed unsafe blocks.
 - Added tests suite for `FFTRef` and `FFTAvx` backends.

### Other
 - Fixed a few minor bugs.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-25
 - Initial release.
